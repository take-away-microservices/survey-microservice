# A Survey Microservice
A microservice that handles the creation and storage of surveys and their respective questions and answers. The idea is to give the most versatility possible when defining the structure of the questions. This makes the use of a document based database pretty much the way to go.

See the tests for tentative question definitions and make sure to read the `NOTE` and `TODO` comments.
